# Avocado @ U.S. [Link to Website](https://avocado-usa.herokuapp.com/)

Are you an avocado lover?

I do enjoy eating this fruit (avocado is a fruit not a vegetable), and loving the color combination! These two reasons brought me to create a funny informative infographic for the avocado after I browsed a beautiful data in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices). Only problem is the data is a bit outdated - covered from 2016 to 2018, I decided to dig more data set that can provide a more recent time range with interesting facts.

- TEAM SIZE : 1
- TIME FRAME : 4 weeks
- TOOLS : Adobe Illustrator, pure canvas with JavaScript, D3.js, Deploying Heroku with Node.JS Express
- MY ROLE : Data Visualization, Full-stack Web Dev

## Data Visualization

#### ⚬ Transition with @keyframes in css
Transition or animation in code was my major purpose of the project, and applying @keyframes in CSS was my luck. I found out it is one of the easiest way to make SVG animated with various options - transition, rotation, scale, and all of them at once. 
#### ⚬ Using PURE JavaScript as much as I can
Since I Kept using D3 library more than I thought, I decided to write in pure JavaScript for this project. There are two tags of creating elements/nodes - SVG tag and Canvas tag. I applied canvas first, just because it allows both creating and animating the elements at once. Then, I recreated avocado infographic using svg tag in Dom with @keyframes in CSS.
#### ⚬ Applying D3 for the Treemap and U.S. map
Data gathering from three different geoJSON and restructuring and mixing among them were the major thing for drawing the treemap and U.S. map. The color scheme of these two areas is also extremely important to this infographic's entire look, so put much effort on designing the view.
